                   Added -fno-optimize-sibling call to avoid unexpected
                     optimizations (we found that sometimes some routines were
                     called directly skipping routines: for example,
                     misc_interface calls did not appear)
                   Simplified behavior with/without -e and with/without BFD

                     * no bfd support / no -e / -e and invalid binary,
                       addresses are left unchanged in the trace
                     * -e binary translates addresses to source code through
                       dictionary

                    implementations rely their MPI fortran symbols to C symbols (MN/MPICH) and others do
                    not (AIX/POE).
   * (28/May/2009) Changes in calltrace (and similar information). Uniformization of routines and lines:
